Below Functionality is being elaborated with help of Pycharm IDE.

Here I have created an expense tracker project which basically provides functionality of adding, viewing, expense tracking mechanism and saving expenses into file for future reference purpose.

Select option 1 to Add 2 to view, 3 to track , 4 to save and 5 to save and Exit on console options while running the program.

All the functions are placed in main.py file of source project folder.
